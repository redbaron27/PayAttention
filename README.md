With the recent increased usage in video conferencing, many people have been able to communicate with coworkers from the comfort of their home. However, video conferencing loses some of the key physical cues that people use to properly and fully communicate with each other. Thus, the limitations of video conference calls can lead to a decrease in team productivity. PayAttention aims to alleviate these problems by allowing people to better understand each other. 

In-person communications allow us to read each other’s body language which we unconsciously interpret as emotional communication. PayAttention helps you understand a team’s emotional response to your slides, talking-points, and feedback. Simply upload your video, select your preferences and receive immediate results!
